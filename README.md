Z-Way uses SysVinit as start/ stop mechanism.

This project deals with the topic of how to migrate to the modern **Systemd**, availabe in
many current Linux distributions, to take advantage of its benefits.

A detailed discussion of the pros and cons and the necessary modules can be found

## Installation

Download the package **MxSystemd** and store it into the Z-Way folder 
**userModules**.
Make the bash scripts executable, if they aren't (`sudo chmod a+x *.bash`)
